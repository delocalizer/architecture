# 3. Data security policy

Date: 2024-10-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Before we start building and deploying things we should adopt a data security policy. It should be **useful**: detailed enough to guide decision-making, but not so detailed that it's impractical to implement.

## Decision

We will follow the recommendations and best practices outlined in the GA4GH [Data Security Infrastructure Policy](https://github.com/ga4gh/data-security/tree/master/DSIP) (DSIP).

## Consequences

Services and operations will be designed and assessed against the recommendations in the DSIP. This takes effort. The payoff is a better understanding and mitigation of risks.
