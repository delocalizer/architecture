[Y-statements](https://medium.com/olzzio/y-statements-10eb07b5a177)

In short, the Y-statement is as follows:

> In the context of `<use case/user story u>`, facing `<concern c>` we decided for `<option o>` to achieve `<quality q>`, accepting `<downside d>`.

The long form of it is as follows (extra section “because”):

> In the context of `<use case/user story u>`, facing `<concern c>` we decided for `<option o>` and neglected `<other options>`, to achieve `<system qualities/desired consequences>`, accepting `<downside d/undesired consequences>`, because `<additional rationale>`.
