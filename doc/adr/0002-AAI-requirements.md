# 2. AAI requirements

Date: 2024-10-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

BioCloud need a base set of requirements to plan their next 6 months dev work
on AAI solution. At this pre-contract stage GUARDIANS projects have not yet
carried out detailed requirements gathering; we have to make an educated guess
as to what is required.

## Decision

BioCloud have an existing AAI requirements document generated from previous
HGP work we'll use as a template, selecting those which Must/Should/Could be
required at 6 and 12 month timepoints, as determined from what and when AAI
integrations appear in the draft schedules for the GUARDIANS partner projects.
The selected requirements are detailed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10eIY5Hcs9bLPnC-Y9AX2aOyZm5gQvaXXxxHUEkaggmA/edit?gid=0#gid=0). The
alignment against 6 and 12 months timepoints is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iVx33h1OYESVyn6lB-2zjZGf1xlUcATfdoDH34V7VsY/edit?usp=sharing).

## Consequences

A set of draft AAI requirements for GUARDIANS makes it easier for BioCloud to
plan and prioritize stories for the next 6 months of their internal AAI
project. It can also inform a more formal set of requirements to be put to AAF
once the GUARDIANS partners complete their analysis. It is expected that
refinement and addition of requirements to the draft will be needed. A risk is
that the template requirements don't cover all the GUARDIANS core use cases and
the BioCloud work is not prioritized correctly to align with GUARDIANS project
delivery schedules. This can be mitigated by executing formal requirements
analysis as early as possible once partners' detailed project plans are
created.
