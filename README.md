Architectural artefacts for the GUARDIANS program

> "The Documentary Hypothesis" — amid a wash of [documentation], a small number of documents become the critical pivots around which every project's management revolves. These are the manager's chief personal tools.

Transparency principle:

* Technical standards, architecture diagrams, and even module interfaces should be documented and visible. Additionally, the decisions that led to a design should be documented and visible.

Currency principle:

* An design artefact's tense should be clearly identifiable — past, present or future. Does it represent a  system state, a current system state, or a design goal?
